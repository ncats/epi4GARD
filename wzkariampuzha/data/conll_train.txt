21	Dutch	champions	Ajax	Amsterdam	faltered	in	their	second	league	match	of	the	season	on	Saturday	losing	2-0	away	at	Heerenveen	.	7	0	3	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	3	0
35	Ajax	,	who	had	a	dismal	series	of	pre-season	results	before	beating	NAC	of	Breda	in	their	opening	game	,	had	the	best	of	an	entertaining	first	half	but	failed	to	break	the	deadlock	.	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	3	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
36	Eight	minutes	after	the	interval	,	Heerenveen	's	Romeo	Wouden	broke	through	the	Amsterdam	defence	,	left	defender	John	Veldman	standing	and	curled	the	ball	beyond	goalkeeper	Edwin	van	der	Sar	into	the	Ajax	net	.	0	0	0	0	0	0	3	0	1	2	0	0	0	5	0	0	0	0	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	2	2	2	0	0	3	0	0
29	Ajax	,	without	injured	defenders	Marcio	Santos	and	Winston	Bogarde	and	strikers	Jari	Litmanen	and	Marc	Overmars	,	then	stepped	up	the	pace	and	looked	certain	to	equalise	.	3	0	0	0	0	1	2	0	1	2	0	0	1	2	0	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
33	But	they	left	gaps	at	the	back	and	on	73	minutes	Danish	striker	Jon	Dahl	Tomasson	rushed	out	of	his	own	half	,	beat	the	Ajax	defence	and	lobbed	van	der	Sar	.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	7	0	1	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	3	0	0	0	1	2	2	0
37	The	defeat	means	Ajax	's	main	title	contenders	PSV	Eindhoven	,	who	beat	the	champions	3-0	in	the	traditional	league	curtain-raiser	,	can	go	three	points	clear	of	their	rivals	if	they	beat	Groningen	on	Sunday	.	0	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	3	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	3	0	0	0

31	Teenager	Yuuichi	Takeda	,	racing	in	only	his	first	season	,	outclassed	the	big	names	to	win	the	first	race	in	round	nine	of	the	world	superbike	championship	on	Sunday	.	0	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
32	Takeda	,	18	,	showed	poise	far	beyond	his	years	to	overtake	Australian	Ducati	rider	Troy	Corser	,	last	year	's	championship	runner-up	,	with	four	of	the	25	laps	left	.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	7	3	0	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
32	Honda	's	Takeda	was	pursued	past	Corser	by	the	Yamaha	duo	of	Noriyuki	Haga	and	Wataru	Yoshikawa	with	Haga	briefly	taking	the	lead	in	the	final	chicane	on	the	last	lap	.	3	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	3	0	0	1	2	0	1	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
21	But	Takeda	found	one	more	spurt	of	power	to	just	take	the	flag	first	with	Haga	second	and	Yoshikawa	third	.	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0

31	Corser	,	who	crashed	during	practice	on	Friday	,	limped	in	fourth	,	four	seconds	behind	Takeda	with	championship	leader	Aaron	Slight	of	New	Zealand	11	seconds	behind	the	winner	.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	2	0	5	6	0	0	0	0	0	0
29	In	the	second	race	,	Takeda	again	challenged	strongly	until	the	fifth	lap	from	the	end	when	he	crashed	while	running	second	to	eventual	race	winner	Takuma	Aoki	.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	2	0
32	Aoki	,	the	elder	brother	of	reigning	125cc	world	champion	Haruchika	,	had	a	race-long	duel	with	John	Kocinski	of	the	United	States	on	a	Ducati	before	taking	the	chequered	flag	.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	2	0	0	5	6	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0
28	Kocinski	led	for	the	early	laps	before	he	was	passed	first	by	Aoki	,	who	recorded	the	fastest	lap	of	147.786	kph	,	and	then	by	Takeda	.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

32	But	the	strong	showing	by	the	Japanese	riders	did	not	alter	the	championship	table	with	Slight	still	leading	on	280	points	,	followed	by	Corser	with	269	and	Kocinski	with	254	.	0	0	0	0	0	0	7	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0

33	Chris	Lewis	did	his	best	to	forget	his	controversial	omission	from	the	England	one-day	squad	on	Sunday	but	could	not	prevent	Pakistan	reasserting	their	dominance	in	the	final	test	at	The	Oval	.	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	5	6	0
53	A	super	piece	of	fielding	by	Lewis	,	dropped	as	a	disciplinary	measure	after	arriving	only	35	minutes	before	the	start	on	the	fourth	morning	,	provided	the	only	bright	spot	for	England	as	the	touring	team	batted	on	to	reach	413	for	five	at	the	interval	,	a	lead	of	87	.	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

39	Michael	Stich	nearly	pulled	out	of	the	U.S.	Open	in	protest	over	the	men	's	seeding	fiasco	but	the	former	Wimbledon	champion	was	glad	he	stayed	after	sweating	out	a	four-set	win	on	Monday	over	qualifier	Tommy	Haas	.	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	7	8	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	7	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	2	0

33	"	But	there	are	so	many	reasons	to	play	,	especially	spectators	and	the	kids	who	come	out	here	and	want	to	enjoy	watching	tennis	,	that	I	decided	to	stay	.	"	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
33	In	a	break	from	tradition	,	the	Open	did	not	seed	in	strict	accordance	with	ATP	rankings	,	instead	taking	into	account	other	factors	that	raised	objections	of	favourtism	toward	U.S.	players	.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	7	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	5	0	0
39	One	prominent	player	that	did	not	stay	for	the	Open	was	French	Open	champion	Yvegeny	Kafelnikov	,	who	after	being	dropped	three	spots	from	his	ATP	ranking	to	a	seventh	seeding	,	withdrew	and	returned	home	to	Russia	.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	7	0	7	8	0	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	5	0

27	At	a	news	conference	attended	by	approximately	50	players	on	Sunday	,	U.S.	Davis	Cup	player	Todd	Martin	expressed	the	players	'	outrage	at	the	seedings	.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	5	7	8	0	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
46	"	The	way	the	U.S.	Open	has	seeded	here	,	tampering	with	the	ranking	system	,	has	tarnished	the	image	and	reputation	of	this	U.S.	Open	in	the	players	'	mind	,	and	we	think	that	is	damaging	to	our	sport	,	"	Martin	said	.	0	0	0	0	7	8	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	7	8	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0

25	But	once	the	27-year-old	Stich	got	on	the	court	,	he	focused	his	energies	on	trying	to	win	the	year	's	last	Grand	Slam	.	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	7	8	0
22	He	took	a	positive	first	step	with	his	6-3	1-6	6-1	7-5	win	over	compatriot	Haas	on	a	sun-baked	Grandstand	court	.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	7	0	0
39	Others	advancing	early	on	Monday	included	11th-seeded	American	Malivai	Washington	,	the	Wimbledon	runner-up	,	Sweden	's	Magnus	Gustafsson	,	and	two-time	former	French	Open	champion	Sergi	Bruguera	of	Spain	,	who	will	be	Stich	's	next	opponent	.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	7	1	2	0	0	7	0	0	5	0	1	2	0	0	0	0	7	8	0	1	2	0	5	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
27	The	suspicion	,	however	,	lingers	in	Stich	's	mind	that	U.S.	Open	officials	did	tamper	with	the	seeding	process	in	order	to	benefit	homegrown	players	.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	7	8	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
37	"	I	get	the	feeling	that	everything	is	done	here	for	the	American	players	and	they	forget	about	all	the	other	players	,	"	said	Stich	,	who	lost	the	1994	Open	final	to	Andre	Agassi	.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	7	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	7	0	0	1	2	0
24	It	was	Agassi	who	was	at	the	centre	of	the	controversy	that	engulfed	the	tournament	since	the	original	draw	was	completed	on	Wednesday	.	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
21	The	flamboyant	American	star	was	bumped	up	two	spots	from	his	ATP	ranking	of	eight	to	a	seeding	of	six	.	0	0	7	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
39	"	He	(	Agassi	)	should	be	seeded	the	way	he	is	playing	tennis	right	now	,	"	said	Stich	about	the	unfairness	of	moving	up	Agassi	,	who	made	early	exits	from	the	French	Open	and	Wimbledon	.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	7	8	0	7	0
26	Stich	,	not	seeded	here	for	the	first	time	since	1990	,	might	have	benefitted	from	some	fiddling	with	the	seedings	himself	after	Kafelnikov	withdrew	.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
42	Ranked	18th	in	the	world	,	Stich	might	have	been	slipped	into	that	spot	ahead	of	Spain	's	Felix	Mantilla	,	who	is	16th	but	had	never	been	played	in	the	Open	and	had	been	left	out	of	the	seedings	originally	.	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	5	0	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	7	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

27	Atletico	came	within	a	whisker	of	taking	the	Cup	on	the	away-goal	rule	but	squandered	several	chances	after	going	3-1	ahead	15	minutes	from	the	end	.	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	7	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
29	Juan	Lopez	gave	Atletico	the	lead	midway	through	the	first	half	after	Barcelona	fullback	Albert	Ferrer	and	substitute	goalkeeper	Julen	Lopetegui	failed	to	clear	a	Milinko	Pantic	cross	.	1	2	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	3	0	1	2	0	0	0	1	2	0	0	0	0	1	2	0	0
34	Barcelona	's	Hristo	Stoichkov	made	his	only	significant	contribution	of	the	evening	10	minutes	after	halftime	when	Sergi	Barjuan	broke	down	the	right	to	set	up	the	fiery	Bulgarian	with	a	simple	equaliser	.	3	0	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	7	0	0	0	0	0
30	But	Atletico	struck	back	almost	immediately	through	new	signing	Juan	Eduardo	Esnaider	and	then	Serbian	set-piece	specialist	Pantic	made	it	3-1	with	a	superb	free-kick	in	the	75th	minute	.	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	2	2	0	0	7	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
